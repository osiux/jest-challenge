## Jest Challenge - 03/16/2018

### Description
Set up a project using Webpack 4, Babel, Jest, Enzyme, React and any other tool that you may find necessary.  This will leave you with a basic setup. It is recommended that you do all these yourself, instead of using tools like `create-react-app` for learning purposes.

Next, please write a React component that have a counter. This counter is only increased, decreased or reset by buttons. The buttons should be their own component, as well the component to display the counter. The structure is all up to you, and how the components are made.

- If I press the [-] button, the counter should be decreased by one.
- If I press the [Reset] button, the counter should reset to cero.
- If I press the [+] button, the counter should increase by one.

The styling is optional, but it will count as extra credits. Try things like CSS modules, or style-components, etc. 

The last step is to write, unit tests for all the components you built, and a integration test to make sure everything works together. 

### Evaluation criteria
- [ ] Setup is correct. Webpack gives you the correct bundle, and coded is correctly transpiled.
- [ ] Package.json have proper scripts to run the project. Only build is fine.
- [ ] The counter should meet the requirement, and change when buttons are clicked.
- [ ] Code structure
- [ ] Code quality
- [ ] Test cases, and coverage
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Surprise me!

### Notes
- Do not copy and paste code, I want all the code to come from you
  - Except if you copy original docs like webpack docs.
- Jest Snapshots don't count as tests
